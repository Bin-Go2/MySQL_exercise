## 1173. Immediate Food Delivery I(Easy)

requirement:  find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.

example:

table name : Delivery

| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |


=>


| immediate_percentage |
|----------------------|
| 33.33                |

### solution:

```
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(*)/counts*100,2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery, (SELECT COUNT(*) AS counts FROM Delivery) AS t
WHERE order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date;

```

how to use the global varible after `FROM`:

1. Every derived table must have its own alias, which means we have to add AS t after the from ...
`(SELECT COUNT(*) AS counts  FROM Delivery) Wrong`
2. The varible should have name ,which means we have add AS counts 
`(SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM Delivery)  Wrong`
