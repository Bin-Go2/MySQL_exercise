### solution:

```
SELECT guest.team_id,guest.team_name,guest.guest_goals + host.host_points AS
num_points
FROM 
(
SELECT t.team_id,t.team_name,
SUM(CASE 
WHEN m1.guest_goals > m1.host_goals THEN 3
WHEN m1.guest_goals = m1.host_goals THEN 1
ELSE 0
END )AS guest_goals

FROM  Teams t
LEFT JOIN  
Matches m1
ON 
t.team_id = m1.guest_team
GROUP BY t.team_id
) AS guest

JOIN

(SELECT t.team_id,t.team_name,
SUM(CASE 
WHEN m1.host_goals > m1.guest_goals THEN 3
WHEN m1.host_goals = m1.guest_goals THEN 1
ELSE 0
END )AS host_points

FROM  Teams t
LEFT JOIN  
Matches m1
ON 
t.team_id = m1.host_team
GROUP BY t.team_id

) AS host 

ON host.team_id = guest.team_id

ORDER BY num_points DESC,guest.team_id;

```


hint :
first get the team's host point  and get the team's guest point and then combine them
