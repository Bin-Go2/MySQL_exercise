### solution:

```
SELECT d.Name AS Department,e.Name AS Employee,e.Salary
FROM Employee AS e
JOIN
Department d
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE (e.DepartmentId,e.Salary) in (SELECT  DepartmentId, Salary
                                    FROM Employee AS e1
                                    WHERE (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary) 
                                            FROM Employee AS e2
                                            WHERE 
                                            e2.Salary>=e1.Salary 
                                            and e2.DepartmentId = e1.DepartmentId
                                            )IN (1,2,3))
ORDER BY Department,e.Salary DESC;

```


There is a concept about this question:
window function
