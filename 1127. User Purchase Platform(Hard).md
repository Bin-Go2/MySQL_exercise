## 1127. User Purchase Platform(Hard)

requirement: 
find the total number of users and the total amount spent using mobile only, desktop only and both mobile and desktop together for each date.


example:

table name : Spending

| user_id | spend_date | platform | amount |
|---------|------------|----------|--------|
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100    |


=>

| spend_date | platform | total_amount | total_users |
|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | both     | 200          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | both     | 0            | 0           |


### solution:

```
ELECT DISTINCT s.spend_date, 'desktop' AS platform, IFNULL(desktop.total_amount,0) AS total_amount,
IFNULL(desktop.total_users,0) AS total_users

FROM  Spending s
LEFT JOIN

(
SELECT spend_date,platform,SUM(amount) AS total_amount, COUNT(user_id) AS total_users
FROM    
        (SELECT * FROM  Spending WHERE (user_id,spend_date) NOT IN 
                            (SELECT user_id,spend_date
                            FROM Spending
                            GROUP BY user_id,spend_date
                            HAVING COUNT(*) = 2)
        ) AS t
WHERE platform ='desktop'
GROUP BY spend_date,platform  
)  desktop

ON s.spend_date = desktop.spend_date

UNION


SELECT DISTINCT s.spend_date, 'mobile' AS platform, IFNULL(moblie.total_amount,0) AS total_amount,
IFNULL(moblie.total_users,0) AS total_users

FROM  Spending s
LEFT JOIN
(
SELECT spend_date,platform,SUM(amount) AS total_amount, COUNT(user_id) AS total_users
FROM 
(SELECT * FROM  Spending WHERE (user_id,spend_date) NOT IN 
                            (SELECT user_id,spend_date
                            FROM Spending
                            GROUP BY user_id,spend_date
                            HAVING COUNT(*) = 2)
        ) AS t
WHERE platform ='mobile'
GROUP BY spend_date,platform
    
) moblie
ON s.spend_date = moblie.spend_date

UNION


SELECT DISTINCT s.spend_date, 'both' AS platform, IFNULL(b0th.total_amount,0) AS total_amount,
IFNULL(b0th.total_users,0) AS total_users
FROM Spending s

LEFT JOIN 

(  
SELECT  spend_date,SUM(total_amount) AS total_amount, COUNT(user_id) AS total_users
FROM
    (SELECT user_id,spend_date,SUM(amount)  AS total_amount
    FROM Spending
    GROUP BY user_id,spend_date
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 2) AS m
GROUP BY spend_date
)  AS b0th

ON s.spend_date = b0th.spend_date;


```


divide and conquer


1.mobile
2.desktop
3.both
