## 180. Consecutive Numbers(Medium)

requirement: find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

example:

table name : Logs

| Id | Num |
|----|-----|
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |

=>

| ConsecutiveNums |
|-----------------|
| 1               |



### solution1:

```
SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE (l1.Id = l2.Id-1 AND l1.Id = l3.Id-2 ) AND
      (l1.Num = l2.Num And l1.Num = l3.Num);

```
