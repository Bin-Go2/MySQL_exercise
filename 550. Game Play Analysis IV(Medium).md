## 550. Game Play Analysis IV(Medium)

requirement: the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places


example:

table name : Activity

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |


=>

| fraction  |
|-----------|
| 0.33      |



### solution:

```
SELECT ROUND( COUNT(a.player_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity),2) AS fraction
FROM Activity a 
JOIN
(
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
) AS t
ON a.player_id  = t.player_id AND a.event_date - t.first_login = 1 ;

```


Keep an eye on this sentence:

at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date,

FOR THE FIRST LOGIN DATE.
