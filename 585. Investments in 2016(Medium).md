## 585. Investments in 2016(Medium)

requirement: the sum of all total investment values in 2016 (TIV_2016), to a scale of 2 decimal places, for all policy holders who meet the following criteria:

1.Have the same TIV_2015 value as one or more other policyholders.
2.Are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e.: the (latitude, longitude) attribute pairs must be unique).

example:

table name : insurance

| PID | TIV_2015 | TIV_2016 | LAT | LON |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |
=>

| TIV_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |



### solution:

```

SELECT ROUND(SUM(TIV_2016),2) AS TIV_2016
FROM insurance 
WHERE TIV_2015 IN
        (SELECT TIV_2015 FROM insurance GROUP BY  TIV_2015 HAVING COUNT(TIV_2015)>1)
         AND CONCAT(LAT,LON) IN   
        (SELECT CONCAT(LAT,LON) AS location FROM insurance GROUP BY location HAVING COUNT(location) =1); 

```


this question we need to meet its requirments:

1. location should be unqie 
2. TIV_2015 should be multiple
