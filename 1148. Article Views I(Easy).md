### solution1:

```
SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY author_id;

```




###  solution2:

```
SELECT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
GROUP BY author_id
ORDER BY author_id;

```





hint:

It's pretty important to have a look at the table structure, and when a table doesn't have a primary key, 
we must have to consider the deplicated rows!!!'



### There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows. Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article
