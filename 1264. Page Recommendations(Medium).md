## 1264. Page Recommendations(Medium)

requirement:   Write an SQL query to recommend pages to the user with user_id = 1 using the pages that your friends liked. It should not recommend pages you already liked.

example:

table name : Friendship

| user1_id | user2_id |
|----------|----------|
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 6        | 1        |


table name : Likes 

| user_id | page_id |
|---------|---------|
| 1       | 88      |
| 2       | 23      |
| 3       | 24      |
| 4       | 56      |
| 5       | 11      |
| 6       | 33      |
| 2       | 77      |
| 3       | 77      |
| 6       | 88      |


=>

| recommended_page |
|------------------|
| 23               |
| 24               |
| 56               |
| 33               |
| 77               |

### solution:

```
SELECT DISTINCT page_id AS recommended_page
FROM Likes L,
(SELECT user2_id AS id FROM Friendship WHERE user1_id = 1
UNION
SELECT user1_id AS id FROM Friendship WHERE user2_id = 1
 )  AS F
WHERE F.id = L.user_id  
AND page_id NOT IN (SELECT page_id FROM Likes WHERE user_id=1 );

```

If I use 
page_id != (SELECT page_id FROM Likes WHERE user_id=1 )
the answer will be wrong.

because `(SELECT page_id FROM Likes WHERE user_id=1 )` will return null and we can't use !=

another way is using default value 

page_id != IFNULL((SELECT page_id FROM Likes WHERE user_id=1 ),99999999);

but when I execute the test case , also somthing wrong 

It's because the user 1 can have more than 1 pages_id like
