| 3          | 4         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |


=>

| id   |
|------|
| 5    |
| 6    |


### solution:

```
SELECT DISTINCT viewer_id AS id 
FROM   (SELECT DISTINCT * FROM Views) AS t
GROUP BY viewer_id,view_date 
HAVING COUNT(viewer_id)>1  

```


hint:

It's pretty important to have a look at the table structure, and when a table doesn't have a primary key, 
we must have to consider the deplicated rows!!!'



### There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows. Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article
