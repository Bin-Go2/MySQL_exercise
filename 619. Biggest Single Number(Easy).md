## 619. Biggest Single Number(Easy)
requirement:  biggest number, which only appears once.

example:

table name : my_numbers


|num|
|---|
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 

=>

|num|
|---|
| 6 |



### solution1:

```
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM 
    (SELECT num 
    FROM my_numbers 
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(num) =1 
    ) AS temp_table;
```
When query the value from a empty table, we can get null.

### solution2:

```
SELECT IFNULL(
	(SELECT MAX(num)
	    FROM my_numbers 
	    GROUP BY num
	    HAVING COUNT(num) =1),NULL
) AS num;

```
Sometimes a safe deed is to use ifnull when we don't know whether the return result is [ ] or [null]
