### solution1:

```
SELECT DISTINCT t1.*
FROM  stadium t1, stadium t2, stadium t3
WHERE (t1.people>=100 AND t2.people>=100 AND t3.people>=100) AND
    (
        
        (t1.id - t2.id = 1 and t1.id - t3.id = 2 and t2.id - t3.id =1) OR
        (t2.id - t1.id = 1 and t2.id - t3.id = 2 and t1.id - t3.id =1) OR
        (t3.id - t2.id = 1 and t2.id - t1.id = 1 and t3.id - t1.id =2)
    
    )
ORDER BY t1.id;

```

Keep an eye on the `DISTINCT` and  the `conditions` 
AND use multiple tables in the WHERE is called the ` equijoin syntax `, it has the same function as INNER JOIN
