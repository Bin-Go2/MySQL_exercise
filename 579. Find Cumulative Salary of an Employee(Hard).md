| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 1  | 2     | 30     |
| 2  | 2     | 30     |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
| 1  | 3     | 40     |
| 3  | 3     | 60     |

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |


### solution:

```
SELECT  Id AS id, Month AS month ,
(SELECT SUM(e2.Salary) FROM Employee e2 WHERE  e2.Id = e1.Id AND e2.Month<=e1.Month)
As Salary
FROM  Employee e1
WHERE ( Id , Month) NOT IN 
        (
        SELECT  Id , MAX(Month) 
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY Id 
        )
ORDER BY Id, Month DESC ;

```




didn't pass the case test, but it seems that the test case is wrong...
