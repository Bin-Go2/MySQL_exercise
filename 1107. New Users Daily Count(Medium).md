## 1107. New Users Daily Count(Medium)

requirement:  reports for every date within at most 90 days from today, the number of users that logged in for the first time on that date. Assume today is 2019-06-30.
 
example:

table name : Traffic

| user_id | activity | activity_date |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 1       | login    | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | homepage | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | logout   | 2019-05-01    |
| 2       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 2       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 3       | login    | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | jobs     | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | logout   | 2019-01-01    |
| 4       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | groups   | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |


=>

| login_date | user_count  |
|------------|-------------|
| 2019-05-01 | 1           |
| 2019-06-21 | 2           |


### solution:

```
SELECT login_date,COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM
(
    SELECT user_id, MIN(activity_date) as login_date
    FROM
    (   SELECT user_id,activity_date
        FROM Traffic
        WHERE activity = 'login' 
        GROUP BY user_id,activity_date
    ) AS t1
    GROUP BY user_id
    HAVING login_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-06-30', INTERVAL 90 DAY) AND '2019-06-30'
) AS t2
GROUP BY login_date;

```
