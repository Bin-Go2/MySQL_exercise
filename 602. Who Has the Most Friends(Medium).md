## 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends(Medium)

requirement: find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number.

example:

table name : request_accepted

| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date|
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
=>

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |



### solution:

```
SELECT id, SUM(num) AS num
FROM
(
	SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(requester_id) AS num 
	FROM request_accepted
	GROUP BY requester_id
	
	UNION ALL 
	
	SELECT accepter_id AS id , COUNT(accepter_id) AS num 
	FROM request_accepted
	GROUP BY accepter_id
) AS t
GROUP BY id 
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

hint: if using  UNION  that will be an error.
