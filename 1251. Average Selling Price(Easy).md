## 1251. Average Selling Price(Easy)

requirement: find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

example:

table name : Prices

| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
|------------|------------|------------|--------|
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |

table name: UnitsSold

| product_id | purchase_date | units |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
There is no primary key for this table


=>

| product_id | average_price |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |

### solution:

```

SELECT a.product_id ,ROUND(b.sums/a.units,2) AS average_price
FROM
(
SELECT product_id,SUM(units) as units
FROM  (SELECT DISTINCT * FROM UnitsSold) AS t
GROUP BY product_id
) a, 

(SELECT p.product_id , SUM(p.price*t.units)  AS sums
FROM Prices p,  (SELECT DISTINCT * FROM UnitsSold) AS t
WHERE p.product_id = t.product_id AND t.purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id) b 

WHERE a.product_id = b.product_id

```
