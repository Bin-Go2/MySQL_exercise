## 176. Second Highest Salary(Easy)

requirement: second highest salary from the Employee table.

example:

table name : Employee

| Id | Salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

=>

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| 200                 |



### solution1:

```
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT  MAX(Salary)
                FROM Employee );

```

### solution2:
```
SELECT 
	IFNULL((SELECT DISTINCT Salary 
	FROM Employee
	ORDER BY  Salary DESC
	LIMIT 1,1),NULL)  AS SecondHighestSalary;

#consider this situation: only one record, it will return [] but the expectation is null

```



hint: here the logic is dense rank 

usage of `LIMIT`

LIMIT <offset> , <count>
