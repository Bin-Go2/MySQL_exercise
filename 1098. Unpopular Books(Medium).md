### solution1:

```

SELECT books.book_id,books.name
FROM 
    (SELECT  book_id,name FROM Books WHERE available_from < '2019-05-23') AS books
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT book_id, SUM(quantity) AS counts FROM Orders 
     WHERE dispatch_date BETWEEN '2018-06-23' AND '2019-06-23'
     GROUP BY book_id
    ) AS orders
ON  books.book_id = orders.book_id 

WHERE counts <10 OR counts IS NULL; # brilliant

```

why use  LEFT JOIN?

WHERE can come after join !



### solution2:

```
SELECT book_id, name 
FROM
(
SELECT b.book_id ,b.name,SUM(IFNULL(o.quantity,0)) AS num
FROM
(SELECT book_id ,name FROM Books 
WHERE available_from < DATE_SUB('2019-06-23', INTERVAL 1 MONTH) ) AS b
LEFT JOIN  
Orders o 
ON b.book_id = o.book_id AND  dispatch_date BETWEEN '2018-06-23' AND '2019-06-23'

GROUP BY b.book_id
    ) AS t2
    
WHERE t2.num<10 
```
