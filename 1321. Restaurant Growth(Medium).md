##1321. Restaurant Growth(Medium)

requirement:  
Write an SQL query to compute moving average of how much customer paid in a 7 days window (current day + 6 days before) .

there will be at least one customer every day


example:

table name : Customer

| customer_id | name         | visited_on   | amount      |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1           | Jhon         | 2019-01-01   | 100         |
| 2           | Daniel       | 2019-01-02   | 110         |
| 3           | Jade         | 2019-01-03   | 120         |
| 4           | Khaled       | 2019-01-04   | 130         |
| 5           | Winston      | 2019-01-05   | 110         | 
| 6           | Elvis        | 2019-01-06   | 140         | 
| 7           | Anna         | 2019-01-07   | 150         |
| 8           | Maria        | 2019-01-08   | 80          |
| 9           | Jaze         | 2019-01-09   | 110         | 
| 1           | Jhon         | 2019-01-10   | 130         | 
| 3           | Jade         | 2019-01-10   | 150         | 


=>


| visited_on   | amount       | average_amount |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 2019-01-07   | 860          | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08   | 840          | 120            |
| 2019-01-09   | 840          | 120            |
| 2019-01-10   | 1000         | 142.86         |

### solution:

```

SELECT  a.visited_on,SUM(b.amount) AS amount, ROUND(AVG(b.amount),2) AS average_amount
FROM (SELECT visited_on , SUM(amount) AS amount FROM Customer GROUP BY visited_on) AS a
JOIN (SELECT visited_on , SUM(amount) AS amount FROM Customer GROUP BY visited_on ) AS b
ON DATEDIFF(a.visited_on,b.visited_on)>=0 AND DATEDIFF(a.visited_on,b.visited_on)<=6
GROUP BY a.visited_on 
HAVING COUNT(a.visited_on) = 7


```

注意三点：
1、round
2、连接的两个表需要事先处理 因为存在日期相等的一天有多个订单的情况，如果不进行group直接滑动窗格的话会有问题
3、datediff
