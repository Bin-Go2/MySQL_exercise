## 596. Classes More Than 5 Students(Easy)

requirement: all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.

example:

table name : courses

| student | class      |
|---------|------------|
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |

=>


| class   |
|---------|
| Math    |




### solution:

```
SELECT class 
FROM courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student)>=5;

```

here we need to use `DISTINCT` cause there might duplicated rows in the table which means same students attend the same classes more one times,like this:

| student | class      |
|---------|------------|
| A       | Math       |
| A       | Math    	|
| C       | Math       |
