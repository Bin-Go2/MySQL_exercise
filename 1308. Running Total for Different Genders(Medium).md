| M      | 2019-12-18 | 2     |
| M      | 2019-12-25 | 13    |
| M      | 2019-12-30 | 26    |
| M      | 2019-12-31 | 29    |
| M      | 2020-01-07 | 36    |

### solution:

```
SELECT a.gender,a.day, SUM(b.points) AS total 

FROM

    (SELECT gender,day,SUM(score_points) AS points
    FROM Scores
    GROUP BY day,gender
    ORDER BY gender,day
     ) AS a

LEFT JOIN 

     (SELECT gender,day,SUM(score_points) AS points
    FROM Scores
    GROUP BY day,gender
    ORDER BY gender,day
     ) AS b
ON 
a.gender = b.gender  AND  DATEDIFF(a.day,b.day) >= 0

GROUP BY a.gender,a.day

ORDER BY a.gender,a.day

```
