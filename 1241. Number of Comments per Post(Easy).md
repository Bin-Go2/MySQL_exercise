## 1241. Number of Comments per Post(Easy)

requirement:  SQL query to find number of comments per each post.

example:

table name : Submissions

| sub_id  | parent_id  |
|---------|------------|
| 1       | Null       |
| 2       | Null       |
| 1       | Null       |
| 12      | Null       |
| 3       | 1          |
| 5       | 2          |
| 3       | 1          |
| 4       | 1          |
| 9       | 1          |
| 10      | 2          |
| 6       | 7          |



=>

| post_id | number_of_comments |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1       | 3                  |
| 2       | 2                  |
| 12      | 0                  |

### solution:

```
SELECT p.sub_id AS post_id,COUNT(t.sub_id) AS number_of_comments
FROM
(
    SELECT DISTINCT sub_id 
    FROM Submissions 
    WHERE parent_id IS NULL
) AS p 
LEFT JOIN 
(   SELECT DISTINCT sub_id, parent_id  
    FROM Submissions 
) AS t 
ON  p.sub_id  = t.parent_id
GROUP BY p.sub_id;

```

think why here I use `COUNT(t.sub_id)` instead of 
`COUNT(*)`


it will count NULL
