##569. Median Employee Salary(Hard)

requirement:  
Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

example:

table name : Employee

|Id   | Company    | Salary |
|-----|------------|--------|
|1    | A          | 2341   |
|2    | A          | 341    |
|3    | A          | 15     |
|4    | A          | 15314  |
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|7    | B          | 15     |
|8    | B          | 13     |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|10   | B          | 1345   |
|11   | B          | 1221   |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|13   | C          | 2345   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |
|15   | C          | 2645   |
|16   | C          | 2652   |
|17   | C          | 65     |


=>

|Id   | Company    | Salary |
|-----|------------|--------|
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |

### solution:

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below


# first we get the median salary's position
/*
(SELECT Company, 
    (CASE WHEN COUNT(Company)%2 != 0 
    THEN ROUND(COUNT(Company)/2)
    ELSE ROUND(COUNT(Company)/2)
    END) AS median_points
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Company)

UNION

(SELECT Company, 
    (CASE WHEN COUNT(Company)%2 != 0 
    THEN ROUND(COUNT(Company)/2)
    ELSE ROUND(COUNT(Company)/2) + 1
    END) AS median_points
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Company
)
*/

# then we need to rank the salary for each company
/*
SELECT a.Id, a.Company,a.Salary,
(
(SELECT COUNT(*)+ 1 FROM Employee b WHERE a.Company = b.Company AND  a.Salary > b.Salary)
+ 
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee b WHERE a.Company = b.Company AND a.Salary =  b.Salary AND a.Id > b.Id)
) AS ranks
FROM Employee a

*/

# finally we combine all the tables 
SELECT t_rank.Id, t_rank.Company,t_rank.Salary
FROM


    ( (SELECT Company, 
            (CASE WHEN COUNT(Company)%2 != 0 
            THEN ROUND(COUNT(Company)/2)
            ELSE ROUND(COUNT(Company)/2)
            END) AS median_points
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY Company)
        UNION
        (SELECT Company, 
            (CASE WHEN COUNT(Company)%2 != 0 
            THEN ROUND(COUNT(Company)/2)
            ELSE ROUND(COUNT(Company)/2) + 1
            END) AS median_points
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY Company
      )
 
 ) AS T

LEFT JOIN 

(SELECT a.Id, a.Company,a.Salary,
    (
    (SELECT COUNT(*)+ 1 FROM Employee b WHERE a.Company = b.Company AND  a.Salary > b.Salary)
    + 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee b WHERE a.Company = b.Company AND a.Salary =  b.Salary AND a.Id      > b.Id)
    ) AS ranks
    FROM Employee a

) AS t_rank

ON T.Company = t_rank.Company  AND 
T.median_points = t_rank.ranks

```




notice:
1. ranking problem: here is the problem about row_number 
2. median problem: here is a little different from the math's median
3. I tried 4 times and only 1 time passed the test ,other cases showed Timeout.
