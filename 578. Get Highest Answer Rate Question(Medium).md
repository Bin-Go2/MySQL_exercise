### solution:

```
SELECT question_id AS survey_log
FROM 
    (SELECT question_id,
            SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'answer' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_ans,
            SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'show'   THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_show
    FROM survey_log
    GROUP BY question_id) AS t
ORDER BY (num_ans / num_show) DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

trick:

SUM(CASE WHEN conditon THEN 1 ELSE 0)
it's useful when counting numbers
