## 1142. User Activity for the Past 30 Days II(Easy)

requirement:   average number of sessions per user for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively, rounded to 2 decimal places


example:

table name : Activity

| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
|---------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |


=>

| average_sessions_per_user |
|---------------------------|
| 1.33                      |


### solution1:

```
SELECT ROUND(AVG(num),2) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM
(
SELECT  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS num
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY user_id ) AS t;

=> wrong

Output   : {"headers": ["average_sessions_per_user"], "values": [[null]]}
Expected : {"headers":["average_sessions_per_user"],"values":[[0.0]]}




SELECT IFNULL(ROUND(AVG(num),2),0.00) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM
(
SELECT  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS num
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY user_id ) AS t;
```
