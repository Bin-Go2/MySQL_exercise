|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|

| 4            | 3               | 2017-04-18 | 2017-04-28    | 2017-04-25   | Closed |         |

=>

| customer_number |
|-----------------|
| 3               |



### solution:

```
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY  COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

trick:
After we `GROUP BY`, we can use the `COUNT(*)` in the `ORDER BY`
In that way, we don't have to select counts and directly get what we want.
