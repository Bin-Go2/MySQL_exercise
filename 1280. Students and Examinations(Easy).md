requirement: find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

example:

table name : Students

| student_id | student_name |
|----------|----------------|
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
| 13         | John         |
| 6          | Alex         |

table name: Subjects

| subject_name |
|--------------|
| Math         |
| Physics      |
| Programming  |

table name:Examinations

| student_id | subject_name |
|------------+--------------|
| 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Programming  |
| 2          | Programming  |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Math         |
| 13         | Math         |
| 13         | Programming  |
| 13         | Physics      |
| 2          | Math         |
| 1          | Math         |

=>

| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |

### solution:

```

SELECT T.student_id,T.student_name,T.subject_name,COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM
    (SELECT s.student_id,s.student_name,c.subject_name
    FROM Students s, Subjects c
    ) AS T
LEFT JOIN 
Examinations e 
ON T.student_id = e.student_id AND T.subject_name=e.subject_name
GROUP BY student_id,student_name,subject_name
ORDER BY student_id,subject_name

```
