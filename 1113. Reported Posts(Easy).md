## 1113. Reported Posts(Easy)

requirement:  reports the number of posts reported yesterday for each report reason. Assume today is 2019-07-05.

example:

table name : Actions

| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |

=>


| report_reason | report_count |
|---------------|--------------|
| spam          | 1            |
| racism        | 2            |

### solution:

```
SELECT report_reason, COUNT(report_reason) AS report_count
FROM
(
    SELECT  DISTINCT extra AS report_reason, post_id
    FROM Actions
    WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-05',action_date) = 1 AND action = 'report'
) AS T
GROUP BY report_reason;

```
