## 178. Rank Scores(Medium)

requirement:  rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.

example:

table name : Scores

| Id | Score |
|----|-------|
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |

=>

| Score | Rank |
|-------|------|
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |



### solution:

```
SELECT s1.Score,
            (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s2.Score) 
            FROM Scores s2 WHERE s2.Score >= s1.Score) AS Rank
FROM Scores s1
ORDER BY  s1.Score DESC;

```
