requirement:  find for each month and country, the number of approved transactions and their total amount, the number of chargebacks and their total amount.

example:

table name : Transactions

| id   | country | state    | amount | trans_date |
|------|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| 101  | US      | approved | 1000   | 2019-05-18 |
| 102  | US      | declined | 2000   | 2019-05-19 |

| 104  | US      | approved | 4000   | 2019-06-13 |
| 105  | US      | approved | 5000   | 2019-06-15 |


table name : Chargebacks

=>

| month    | country | approved_count | approved_amount | chargeback_count  | chargeback_amount  |
|----------|---------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 2019-05  | US      | 1              | 1000            | 1                 | 2000               |
| 2019-06  | US      | 3              | 12000           | 1                 | 1000               |
| 2019-09  | US      | 0              | 0               | 1                 | 5000               |


### solution:

```

first get the half of the results:

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(trans_date,'%Y-%m') AS month,country,
(SUM( CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) )      AS approved_count,
(SUM( CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END ))  AS approved_amount
FROM  Transactions
GROUP BY month,country



then get the another half resluts
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(c.trans_date,'%Y-%m') AS month ,t.country,SUM(amount) AS chargeback_amount,COUNT(*) AS chargeback_count
FROM Chargebacks c,Transactions t
WHERE c.trans_id = t.id 
GROUP BY month,country

then combin them


==>

SELECT t1.month,t1.country,IFNULL(t2.approved_count,0) AS approved_count,IFNULL(t2.approved_amount,0) AS approved_amount,
t1.chargeback_count,t1.chargeback_amount
FROM

(
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(c.trans_date,'%Y-%m') AS month ,t.country,SUM(amount) AS chargeback_amount,COUNT(*) AS chargeback_count
FROM Chargebacks c,Transactions t
WHERE c.trans_id = t.id 
GROUP BY month,country
) AS t1

LEFT JOIN 

(
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(trans_date,'%Y-%m') AS month,country,
(SUM( CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) )      AS approved_count,
(SUM( CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END ))  AS approved_amount
FROM  Transactions
GROUP BY month,country
) AS t2

ON t1.month = t2.month AND t1.country = t2.country

UNION



SELECT t2.month,t2.country,t2.approved_count,t2.approved_amount,
IFNULL(t1.chargeback_count,0) AS chargeback_count ,IFNULL(t1.chargeback_amount,0) AS chargeback_amount
FROM

(
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(c.trans_date,'%Y-%m') AS month ,t.country,SUM(amount) AS chargeback_amount,COUNT(*) AS chargeback_count
FROM Chargebacks c,Transactions t
WHERE c.trans_id = t.id 
GROUP BY month,country
) AS t1

RIGHT JOIN 

(
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(trans_date,'%Y-%m') AS month,country,
(SUM( CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) )      AS approved_count,
(SUM( CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END ))  AS approved_amount
FROM  Transactions
GROUP BY month,country
HAVING approved_count>0
) AS t2

ON t1.month = t2.month AND t1.country = t2.country


```


this question is totally not medium ~~~

lots of pits !!!

DATE_FORMAT()
UNION
LEFT JOIN
