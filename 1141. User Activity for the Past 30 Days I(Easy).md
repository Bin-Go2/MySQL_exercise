## 1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I(Easy)

requirement:  SQL query to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively


example:

table name : Activity

| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
|---------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |


=>

| day        | active_users |
|------------|--------------|
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |


### solution1:

```
SELECT activity_date AS day,COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users 
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT * FROM Activity ) AS t
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27',activity_date)<30 AND DATEDIFF('2019-07-27',activity_date)>=0
GROUP BY activity_date;

```

hint:
SELECT (DATEDIFF('2019-07-27','2019-06-28'))  => 20   but the question means 
'2019-07-27' is included so we use < 30

### solution2:

```
select activity_date as day , count(distinct user_id) as active_users
from Activity
where activity_date between '2019-06-28' and '2019-07-27' # not6.27  but6.28
group by activity_date

```
