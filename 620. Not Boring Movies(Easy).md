## 620. Not Boring Movies(Easy)
requirement: movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring', order by rating

example:

table name: cinema


|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |

=>


|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |


### solution:

```
SELECT *
FROM cinema
WHERE id %2  =1 AND description !='boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;

```


`id%2=1`  equals to  `mod(id,2)=1 `
we can use these terms interchangeably
