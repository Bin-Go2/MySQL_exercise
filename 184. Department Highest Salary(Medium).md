### solution1:

```
SELECT d.Name AS Department,e.Name AS Employee,e.Salary
FROM Employee e,Department d
WHERE e.DepartmentId = d.Id AND
    (DepartmentId,Salary) IN
        (SELECT DepartmentId,MAX(Salary)
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY DepartmentId);
```

### solution2:

```      
SELECT d.Name AS Department,e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary AS Salary
FROM Employee AS e
LEFT JOIN Department AS d ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE (d.Id,e.Salary) IN 
(SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary) FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId)


# this way is better because of LEFT JOIN.
```
