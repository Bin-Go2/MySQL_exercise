## 1270. All People Report to the Given Manager(Medium)

requirement:  find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

example:

table name : Employees

| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |



=>
| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |

### solution:

```
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE manager_id IN 
(
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employees
    WHERE manager_id IN
    (
        SELECT employee_id
        FROM Employees
        WHERE manager_id  = 1 AND employee_id !=1
    )
)

UNION

 SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employees
    WHERE manager_id IN
    (
        SELECT employee_id
        FROM Employees
        WHERE manager_id  = 1 AND employee_id !=1
    )
    
UNION

 SELECT employee_id
        FROM Employees
        WHERE manager_id  = 1 AND employee_id !=1
        
;
```

this is a nested question...
