## 626. Exchange Seats(Easy)
requirement: change seats for the adjacent students.

example:

table name: seat

| id      |  student|
|---------|---------|
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |

=>

 id      |  student|
|---------|---------|
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |


### solution1:
keep the id constant,change the student 

```
SELECT id ,
CASE 
WHEN s1.id%2=1  THEN IFNULL((SELECT student
                  FROM seat s2
                  WHERE s2.id  = s1.id+1),s1.student)
WHEN s1.id%2=0 THEN (SELECT student
                  FROM seat s3
                  WHERE s3.id  = s1.id-1)
END AS student
FROM seat s1;
```

### solution2:
keep the student constant, change the id 

```
SELECT 
(CASE 
WHEN id%2=1 AND id!=counts THEN id+1
WHEN id%2=1 AND id =counts THEN id
ELSE id-1
END) AS id
, student
FROM seat, (SELECT COUNT(*) AS counts FROM seat) AS temp_table
ORDER BY id;

```
hint: use counts as a global variable


What if change all the row? 
combine the soultion1 and solution2.
