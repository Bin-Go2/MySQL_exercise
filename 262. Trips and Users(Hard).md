| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |

### solution:

```
SELECT Request_at AS Day, 
ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN t.Status != 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips t , Users c, Users d
WHERE Request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03' 
AND t.Client_Id = c.Users_Id AND t.Driver_Id = d.Users_Id
AND  c.Banned = 'No' AND d.Banned = 'No'
GROUP BY Request_at;
```


hint:
1.according to the requirement ,seletc all the trips that held by unbanned clients and drivers between Oct 1, 2013 and Oct 3, 2013.
2.use group by count the cancellation rate

if an alias has space ,we should use quotation '
'Cancellation Rate' instead of Cancellation Rate
