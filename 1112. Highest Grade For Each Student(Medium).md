## 1112. Highest Grade For Each Student(Medium)

requirement:  highest grade with its corresponding course for each student

example:

table name : Enrollments

| student_id | course_id | grade |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |

=>


| student_id | course_id | grade |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |


### solution:

```
SELECT student_id,MIN(course_id) AS course_id, grade FROM Enrollments
WHERE (student_id,grade) IN
    (SELECT  student_id,MAX(grade) 
    FROM Enrollments 
    GROUP BY student_id) 
GROUP BY student_id;  

why group by? 
to meet the requirement of should find the course with the smallest course_id

```
