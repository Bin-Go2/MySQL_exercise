## 584. Find Customer Referee(Easy)
requirement:  list of customers NOT referred by the person with id '2'.

example:

table name : customer

| id   | name | referee_id|
|------|------|-----------|
|    1 | Will |      NULL |
|    2 | Jane |      NULL |
|    3 | Alex |         2 |
|    4 | Bill |      NULL |
|    5 | Zack |         1 |
|    6 | Mark |         2 |
=>

| name |
|------|
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |



### solution:

```
~Wrong answer:
SELECT  name 
FROM customer
WHERE referee_id!=2; 

~Right answer:
SELECT  name 
FROM customer
WHERE referee_id!=2 OR referee_id IS NULL;

```

When we check by attribute, if the attribute is NULL, it cannot be selected.
We should explictly use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`

Professional explanation:
MySQL uses three-valued logic -- TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. 
`SELECT  name 
FROM customer
WHERE referee_id!=2; ` =>

| name |
|------|
| Zack |
