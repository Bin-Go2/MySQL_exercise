## 608. Tree Node(Easy)
requirement: print the node id and the type of the node

example:

table name : tree

| id | p_id |
|----|------|
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
=>

| id | Type |
|----|------|
| 1  | Root |
| 2  | Inner|
| 3  | Leaf |
| 4  | Leaf |
| 5  | Leaf |


### solution:

```
SELECT id,
(CASE
    WHEN p_id  is null THEN 'Root'
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) 
          FROM tree t2 
          WHERE t1.id = t2.p_id) != 0
          THEN 'Inner'
    ELSE 'Leaf'
END) AS Type
FROM tree t1;
```

specify:
only Root  has no parent

only Inner has parent and child

only leaf  has no child
