## 597. Friend Requests I: Overall Acceptance Rate(Easy)

requirement: find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals

hint:
count the total accepted requests (no matter whether they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests to get the acceptance rate.

example:

table name : friend_request

| sender_id | send_to_id |request_date|
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 2          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 3          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 4          | 2016_06-01 |
| 2         | 3          | 2016_06-02 |
| 3         | 4          | 2016-06-09 |

table name : request_accepted

| requester_id | accepter_id |accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-10 |

=>

|accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|


### solution:

```  
SELECT 
(CASE 
    WHEN req_num = 0 THEN 0.00
    ELSE ROUND(acp_num/req_num,2)
END) AS accept_rate
FROM
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id,send_to_id) AS req_num FROM friend_request) AS req_num
,(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT requester_id,accepter_id) AS acp_num FROM request_accepted) AS acp_num

```
