```
# use subquery
SELECT e.employee_id,t.num as team_size
FROM Employee e, (SELECT team_id, COUNT(employee_id) as num FROM Employee GROUP BY team_id ) as t
WHERE e.team_id = t.team_id;

# use join
SELECT t1.employee_id,t2.num as team_size
FROM Employee t1
LEFT JOIN 
(
SELECT team_id, COUNT(employee_id) as num
FROM Employee
GROUP BY  team_id
) as t2
ON t1.team_id = t2.team_id;
